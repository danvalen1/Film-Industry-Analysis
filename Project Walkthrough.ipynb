We worked around that issue by identifying the title variables `primary_title` and `movie` and release date variables `start_year`and `release_date` variables as our keys. As mentioned before these variables did not match in terms of format so, for example, we identified the year string in `release_date` as data that will be used to match release date variables. \n",

This will help decide if it is more beneficial to invest in larger blockbuster movies or if there is more return for smaller, low budget films. A scatterplot was created with the film's budget (production and advertisement costs) on the x-axis and the return on investment as a percentage on the y-axis.

These were the most common genres contained in the data set. Some movies were categorized as more than one genre. Those movies are included in each of the listed genres. For example, if a movie is considered Action and Adventure, it's data in included in both genres because it is representative of both genres. The final category is \"other\" for any movies that did not fall into one of the seven listed genres. \n",

However, thriller movies have the most significant outliers and the highest 75% quartile range (with the exception of the other category).
