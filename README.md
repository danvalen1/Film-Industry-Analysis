## Data Understanding
For the purposes of this analysis we focused primarily on data from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) and The-Numbers.com (TN), two sources that focus on the film industry. Specifically we used datasets that included--on one hand--title, date released, and genre data and--on the other hand--title, date released, production budgets, and box office figures. Below is a summary of the data pertinent to our analysis broken down by file.
